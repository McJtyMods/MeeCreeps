1.2.3 (upcoming):
- Bugfix with storing the correct player with actions that are ongoing while the world is saved

1.2.2:
- WARNING: Do not load any worlds with MeeCreeps 1.2.1 or earlier if you last saved them with MeeCreeps 1.2.2 or later!
- Joseph fixed log warnings due to tile entities being registered with names like "minecraft:meecreeps_portalblock" instead of "meecreeps:portalblock".
- Fixed a typo in fake player name which might cause some issues with other mods (perhaps Mine Colonies)

1.2.1:
- Aemande added support for Menril torches from Integrated Dynamics
- Improved performance for meecreeps trying to follow the player accross dimensions
- When a meecreep cannot be found for some time it will remove the action now. This should prevent actions from staying around forever and possibly eating system resources

1.2.0:
- Made compatible with the latest McJtyLib (3.0.0)
- Make usages of fakeplayer more sane. This might solve some issues in combination with FTB Utilities
